# DEPRECATED
A new Mythos WebUI is in effect. As such, this code is no longer functional. Please use KamaiTachi to track your Mythos scores.

# Chunithm Rating Breakdown
A handy little script to break down your rating on the Mythos network. You can adapt this to your own purposes given you have your full playlog.


# Getting set up and running
Requires any `python3` and the library `lxml`.

Do `pip install lxml` to install the dependency.

Go to the Mythos WebUI, navigate to CHUNITHM, then to your playlog. Save the current webpage and place it in the same folder as this script.

To run the script, just do `python3 analyzer.py YourFileNameHere.htm`
